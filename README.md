# Adventures in C

### Why C?
C is one of the oldest, fastest and most powerful language. 
Programming in C feels great as you find that you are much more closer to the assembly than you could be while coding in other languages.
So to get those basics clear, I opted for using C in this adventure island.
Many complex things like the OS, DBMS, WebServers etc. are written in C.

### Purpose

Well, primary motive of this repository is to learn more about the basics and to build some great things out of them. I have started this repository with simple scripts **pingflood.c** and **portscan.c**, both of them being in the networking section.
But I intend to extend this repo beyond this section.

### Contribute

If you feel like joining me in this adventure, it would make it more exciting for me as more variety , the better the adventure. Feel free to make a **PR** ;)
